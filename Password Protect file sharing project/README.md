This is a nodejs backend project .
This will help to upload any file with an associated password with it.
The backend will then generate a URL
This can be shared then with anyone.
The person opening the file with url must know the password to open that
I used mongo db for storing the file paths.
Nodejs for backend logic .
Multer library for storing the actual files.
